                    <p>It is important for everyone to learn how to use their programming skills to lead a good life and
                        be comfortable with their lifestyle choices. And that’s why, today, we will go through different
                        ways a programmer can monetize his/her skills.</p>

                    <p>Beginners tend to struggle when monetizing their skills. Many of them have no idea where to
                        start, or even what to do with their skills. It is easy to get lost and waste time to do
                        nothing, and that’s why it is necessary to know different ways to make your skills count.</p>

                    <p>The latest trend is showcasing your skills by broadcasting real-world projects and building an
                        audience. Also, don’t overlook traditional methods including freelancing, teaching others, and
                        much more.</p>

                    <p>However, before we start, it is important to understand the need for programmers in the industry.
                        Programmers are in huge demand right now, and the demand will only increase in the near future.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a beginner, you need to make sure you don’t lose focus and be patient in anything you try. As
                        the old saying goes, “there is no shortcut for success,” and resilience is what will help you
                        overcome potential failures.</p>
                    <p>Moving back to the topic, let’s list the ways you can monetize your programming skills even as a
                        beginner. We will be discussing both direct and indirect means. The direct methods can help you
                        start earning immediately, whereas the indirect methods will ensure that you invest in a
                        long-term manner with an eye to future growth. So, why wait? Let’s get started.</p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">How to monetize your programming skills as a beginner</h1>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">1.Start Freelancing</h2>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/freelance.jpg" alt="..." />

                    <p id="first">Freelancing is growing at a rapid race. Even though freelancing is a great option, it does
                        require more attention and patience than a traditional job. You can try many online freelancing
                        platforms such as UpWork, HackerEarth, LiveEdu and others to get started.</p>

                    <p>It is a good idea to start with sites like HackerEarth or LiveEdu as you can practice, compete,
                        broadcast your projects and build your portfolio, allowing clients to go through your projects
                        or watch your code live.</p>

                    <p>With a better way to showcase your skills, you can find valuable prospective clients and work on
                        projects suited to your skill set.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2. Use broadcasting to showcase your talent and build your portfolio
                    </h2>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Livecoding.jpg" alt="..." />
                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before –
                        that’s what living is all about.</span>
                    <p id="second">It is not like a traditional resume where you just list your past projects, and the client needs
                        to go to your GitHub repository. It is more of a visual display of work that you have done, and
                        how you complete assignments.</p>
                    <div>
                        <p>Live streaming offers multiple benefits:</p>
                        <li>The client can easily gauge your work</li>
                        <li>You can connect with like-minded people who can give you work in the future.</li>
                        <li>You can have fun while doing projects.</li>
                    </div>
                    <p>With tons of videos and projects, you are virtually creating a real asset regarding skill display
                        which can help you monetize your programming talents long-term.</p>

                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">3. Work on open-source projects and build a portfolio for long-term
                        benefits </h2>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/opensourceinitiativelogos.jpg" alt="..." />

                    <p id="third">Few people will consider open-source projects as a way to monetize their skill. Yes, you are
                        doing open-source contribution, but you will probably not be getting paid for it (unless you are
                        working as a core team member for an open-source project which qualifies for pay). If you are
                        ambitious, you can also make money from open-source contribution. </p>

                    <p>As a beginner, most of your energy should go in building a good online presence, and open- source
                        projects do help a lot in this regard. You can also choose to broadcast your open-source
                        projects and make the most of your invested time.</p>

                    <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->

                    <h2 class="section-heading">4. Volunteer for a non-profit organization and build relationships</h2>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Volunteer.jpg" alt="..." />
                    <p id="fourth">As a programmer, you need to work with people in the real world. To ensure that you grow in every
                        possible way, it is a good idea to work for coding non-profit organizations.</p>

                    <p>Volunteering for them not only helps you understand the current state of computer science but
                        also helps you get into one of the paid jobs that they may have to offer. Many non-profit
                        platforms also offer placement guidance and internships.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">5. Write about the technology that interests you</h2>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/how-to-write-a-blog-post-writing.jpg" alt="..." />
                    <p id="fifth">As a beginner, you don’t really have to develop apps for a living. There are many other ways you
                        can sustain and earn money. One of them is to become a technical writer or a blogger.</p>

                    <p>Both ways let you utilize your skills and use them to reach a worldwide audience. Working as a
                        writer can easily fetch you good projects with decent payouts. For example, you may have to
                        write the documentation, specifications, and tutorials for a technical product.</p>

                    <p>As a blogger, you can write about anything. You can choose to be a Java blogger and start a Java
                        blogging website, or if you are front-end lover, you can start a blog for front-end engineers.
                        The choice is all yours.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">6. Teach others and earn some hefty amounts</h2>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/imco-ca-class.jpg" alt="..." />
                    <p id="sixth">Becoming a computer teacher is another way to monetize your programming skills. The
                        teacher-to-student ratio is a big issue in modern society. However, it’s slowly being taken care
                        of by schools and universities.</p>

                    <p>Teachers are paid well and are also viewed with respect in our current society. If you are only
                        interested in working online, you can also start by creating online courses and uploading them
                        to different mediums or your own blog.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Now, you are better informed on how to get started. As you can see, there is no single path for
                        beginners. You can choose to be a front-end engineer, a technical writer, a teacher, and much
                        more. All you need to do is find the path that interests you most and keeps walking it until you
                        succeed.</p>

                    <p>If you want to earn your best, then you need to keep all the above points in mind. If you think
                        that some important points have been missed, don’t forget to leave your comments below and let
                        us know.</p>
